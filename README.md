# Number of cord intersection inside Circle
Programming Language: Python

This program calculates the number of intersections among a set of cords inside a circle. It takes a list as an input, where list has two tuple elemnts. The first tuple has radian angle of the cordâ€™s endpoints on the circle, and the second tuple has cord identifier. 

The program has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in either first or the second tuple in the list.
